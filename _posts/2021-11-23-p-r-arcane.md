# Big Success in Animation based on the Video Game

Arcane is based on the video game: League of Legends. League of Legends has become the biggest successful game in the earth. Nowadays Riot Games, the game develop, publish company under Tencent Co. is trying to expend their IP to multi genres such as TV series and another spin-off games.

A few weeks ago, Arcane's last episode was released in Netflix. After I've watched all episodes, what I felt was that everybody can know how much efforts Riot Game has put on this. They are serious indeed. So, I would say this animation is overwhelming the Disney's at least for now.

# Attractive Characters

This guy is a representative villain who endangers the two cities. He looks cruel and merciless at first, but in the end part of this series he shows a moment that he hesitates to accomplish his ultimate goal of his life because of Jinx who is considered a step daughter-like to Silco. This is reflexted in his dialogue in front of Vander's statue. 

Impressive thing is that there's no awkward flow in entire stody deliverying Silco's change. This is the obvious difference from Marvel's series. This one feature is enough to draw applause from the viewers. Speaking of viewers, even if people who don't know the game's story line, there's no problem to follow the story. Even better maybe, because the fans already know their future state.

Amazing work needless to say. It's natural to wait the next season. Of cource, there's a news that Riot is making the sequel season.
