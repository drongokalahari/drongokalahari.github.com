## Abstract
> In this paper, we develop a model based causality inference technique for audit logging that does not require any application instrumentation or kernel modification. It leverages a recent dynamic analysis, dual execution (LDX), that can infer precise causality between system calls but unfortunately requires doubling the resource consumption such as CPU time and memory consumption. For each application, we use LDX to acquire precise causal models for a set of primitive operations. Each model is a sequence of system calls that have inter-dependences, some of them caused by memory operations and hence implicit at the system call level. These models are described by a language that supports various complexity such as regular, context-free, and even context-sensitive. In production run, a novel parser is deployed to parse audit logs (without any enhancement) to model instances and hence derive causality. Our evaluation on a set of real-world programs shows that the technique is highly effective. The generated models can recover causality with 0% false-positives (FP) and false-negatives (FN) for most programs and only 8.3% FP and 5.2% FN in the worst cases. The models also feature excellent composibility, meaning that the models derived from primitive operations can be composed together to describe causality for large and complex real world missions. Applying our technique to attack investigation shows that the system-wide attack causal graphs are highly precise and concise, having better quality than the state-of-the-art.

## Goal
The goal of this paper is to provide a causality analysis technique with the same accuracy as LDX, but does not require any changes of end-user systems, such as instrumenting user applications, modifying the kernel or installing special runtime. Specifically, the end-user only needs to turn on the default audit logging tool that comes with their system, such as Linux Audit, Event Tracing for Windows, and DTrace to collect syscall logs. Upon a security incident, MCI can generate precise causal graphs from the raw log to explain attack causality and assess system damages.

- Improve LDX one step more maintaining same accuracy.

## How
The key idea of MCI is to use **causal models** to parse **raw logs** to derive precise causality information. Specifically, in the offline phase, we use LDX as the causality inference engine to construct models for the applications that will be deployed on an end-user system. A causal model is essentially a sequence of inter-dependent syscalls and their causal relations. Such causalities/dependencies can be induced by system objects, called **explicit dependencies**, as they can be determined by analyzing syscalls alone, or induced by memory operations and control dependences, called **implicit dependences**, which are not visible by analyzing syscall events. Note that LDX can detect both explicit and implicit dependencies.

- LDX (generating models) + audit logs
- Off-line analysis precisely infers causality from a given system call log by constructing causal models and identifying the models in a given audit log.
